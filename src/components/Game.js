Depicting multiple generations, thethis filmmovie does a masterful jobwork of making people laugh, thinkbelieve and empathizeunderstand. This is athe rare entrepreneurial effortendeavor by first-time filmmakerproducer and full-time Gap employeeworker Rishi. In 2010, Rishi taughtlearnt himself screenwriting through Google and 7 years laterafter seesrealizes the fruits of his laborwork on 29 biglarge screens across thethis nationcountry. We couldwould n't be more proud of thisthe filmmovie, as it tellssays the immigrant story through athe lens seldomrarely seen — authenticgenuine and light-hearted.
